# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I felt comfortable but I want to attribute that to being able to go back through the lessons especially the object instance portion of the oop to see what I had made mistakes on. I think I can research topics and find what I am looking for quickly, so that has been a huge strength of mine throughout this entire mod 0 prep. I felt anxious at times trying to make sure my code would work but really satisfied after solving all the problems and assignements through the course.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

My workflow could be better utilized as I am still trying to get a better grasp on taking breaks and not burning myself out quickly. Time managment needs to be worked on as well. 

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

I would like to take away that its okay if something doesnt work right the first time. That its perfectly acceptable to use resources and docs because I cant possinly know everything all the time but I can do my best to find it quickly so that I can push through what Im working on to solve the problem and get to the next task at hand.
